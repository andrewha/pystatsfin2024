These labs are super basic, but still are a good refresher on the topic. Note that these labs are not graded and thus do not count toward passing the course.

The course agenda is as follows:

1. Visualizing and Munging Stock Data
2. Random variables and distribution
3. Sampling and Inference
4. Linear Regression Models for Financial Analysis
